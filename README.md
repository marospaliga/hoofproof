Proof of a Hoof




Many individuals within the blockchain community are actively exploring ways to effectively connect blockchain with real-world objects. This white paper presents a novel solution that bridges the abstract digital world with the tangible and concrete realm, and also simultaneously aim to solve some of biggest global environmental problems.

The presented prototype is just the beginning, with the potential for expansion and optimization. Recognizing the challenge of fully enforcing trust in a decentralized manner, our solution emphasizes shifting the economy toward a more trustworthy environment. This is achieved through a sophisticated system of reputation and charitable staking, empowering local users with global stakeholder support.

Our selection of unique real-world objects, represented as NFTs, is driven by a deep consideration of cultural significance. As Yat Siu, an advocate for genuine digital property rights, emphasises in his article "The critical role of culture and ownership in the metaverse," cultural aspects often surpass utility in driving consumption. Consider the realm of fashion, where choices are not solely dictated by practicality but rather serve as expressions of identity and aspirations.

Amidst the dynamic technological landscape, cultural elements risk being overshadowed by rapidly changing trends. Notably, NFT designs often lack both utility and aesthetic appeal. To anchor our initiative in practicality, commonality, and timeless cultural context, we aim to merge the fast-paced utility of the digital world with the mature day-to-day experiences of the physical world. Ultimately, the best culture is one that is cultivated.


In recognizing the undeniable interconnectedness of animals with humanity, we strategically chose them as NFT nodes. In order to keep the project initialy simple and after extensive research, the cow has emerged as the unequivocal symbol of sustainability and ethical responsibility, mainly becouse of cow’s influence and impact on human society. This integration aims to reshape the narrative around digital assets, positioning NFTs as catalysts for positive social and environmental change. The cow is also chosen for its cultural importance, being considered sacred in Hindu religion, it becomes not only a powerful emblem fostering a harmonious coexistence between technology, culture, and the environment but also it’s protection has basis and is studied deeply by economist and experts on culture. 
	

The profound words of Dr. Sahadeva resonate with our mission: "Because of no contact with the animal world, children are losing contact with nature as they move to a more virtual world. Children today have no clue about nature. Most children in developed countries do not see a live cow or a live horse or an apple tree. How can they protect nature if they do not know it?" (Dasa, Dr. Sahadeva. Capitalism Communism And Cowism – A New Economics For The 21st Century. Soul Science University Press. Kindle Edition).

By integrating blockchain into our initiative, we aim to address this disconnection between humanity and nature. The NFTs, represented by a cow, serve not only as a cultural bridge but also as a means to rekindle a connection with the natural world. As blockchain can quietly supports the independence of self-sustainable communities, it becomes a silent force advocating for environmental awareness and responsibility. In doing so, we aspire to foster a generation that understands and values the importance of protecting nature, paving the way for a more harmonious coexistence between technology, culture, and the environment in the 21st century.




Oracle and staking:



"We're introducing 'Stasis,' our new rating system stored and calculated on the blockchain. This system, showcased in oracle interfaces, ensures transparent monitoring of every member's reputation on the chain. While we provide some basic ideas here, 'Stasis' is a sophisticated tool – for a better grasp, you can refer to the Steemit platform's whitepaper, which shares a similar system."


Stasis Rating System: Unlocking Ethical Momentum
Fostering Stability Through Ethical Engagement:
Stability is the heartbeat of the Stasis Ecosystem. Active and ethical engagement from participants, including projects, stakers, and cow-takers, contributes significantly to this stability. Positive contributions, ethical practices, and practical involvement form the pillars of the Stasis Ecosystem, ensuring a foundation built on responsibility and continuity.
The Essence of Ethical Momentum:
At the core of the system lies Ethical Momentum—a dynamic metric that amplifies as practical and ethical engagement rises. Whether you're a project, a staker, or a cow-taker, earning higher Ethical Momentum unlocks distinct advantages within the Stasis Ecosystem. It's a shared journey where every participant's ethical contributions matter.
Advantages Beyond Transactions: Lower Liquidity Requirements:
A standout feature of the Stasis approach is the rewarding of projects, stakers, and cow-takers with higher Ethical Momentum through lower liquidity requirements. This innovative approach ensures that liquidity isn't solely tied to financial transactions but is also influenced by the stable and ethical contributions of everyone involved.
Reputation as a Universal Currency:
In the Staking System, reputation becomes a universal currency. Whether you're staking, taking care of the cows, or actively engaging with projects, accumulating reputation through positive contributions grants influence. This influence enables participants to vote on merit, reinforcing a delicate equilibrium between stability and ethical impact.
Stasis Beyond Ratings: Cooperative Decision-Making in the HERDS Collective:
Stasis extends beyond a mere rating system; it manifests in cooperative decision-making within the HERDS collective. Members propose and vote on potential investment directions in a democratic and inclusive manner, emphasizing collaboration for the greater good of the entire ecosystem. This cooperative model aligns seamlessly with Stasis principles, highlighting stability, ethical impact, and responsible practices for all participants.




To shortly illustrate what criteria may ethical rating be based on in connection with taking care of cow let us share something from book of Kenneth R. Valpey - ‘Cow Care in Hindu Animal Ethics”. Main thing is to aproach cow’s not just mere NFTs but real subjects with feelings.


“This involves a change in the conception of citizenship that “recognizes that we are all interdependent, and experience varying forms and degrees of agency according to context, and over the life-course”. It then becomes possible to recognize that domestic animals (including bovines) possess, in their own ways, the three capacities specified as required for citizenship. Domestic animals demonstrate (1) the capacity to have a subjective good and the ability to communicate it; (2) the capacity to participate (specifically, by sheer presence in human settlement, as opposed to being made invisible, as in the modern meat industry); and (3) the capacity for cooperation, self-regulation, and reciprocity Among nine specific areas of presup- position for citizenship discussed by the authors, we can give attention to four, with respect to cow care: (1) mobility and the sharing of public space; (2) use of animal products; (3) use of animal labor; and (4) sex and reproduction. “

Technical Proofs Summary: History, Stake, Work


History:
In the Stasis Rating System, history is not just a record; it's a dynamic force that ensures sustained benefits. Long-term staking of a specific cow becomes a testament to past contributions, providing participants with ongoing rewards and recognition. This historical record creates a meaningful connection between participants and their legacy within the ecosystem, fostering a sense of continuity and gratitude.
Stake:
Staking in our ecosystem goes beyond mere asset locking; it's a reputation-shaping mechanism. Particularly in the context of charitable contributions, stakes contribute to a positive public image and enhance participants' controlling power within the ecosystem. This reputation-driven approach not only benefits individuals but also leads to reduced gas consumption in trading activities, promoting a more sustainable and efficient network.
Work:
Innovative and eco-friendly, the concept of "work" within the POH ecosystem extends beyond conventional definitions. We harness the traction power of bulls for mining activities, showcasing a commitment to environmental consciousness. Moreover, our unique proof-of-work mechanism integrates agricultural processes with blockchain technology. By utilizing the anabolic digestion power from cow dung to generate gas for mining, we redefine sustainable mining practices, setting a precedent for green solutions in the blockchain space.



“The gobar gas research station in Uttar Pradesh has established that one cow gives enough cowdung in a year to produce methane gas equivalent to 225 litres of petrol in energy terms. The calorific value table would show that one kg of methane gas is more or less equal in energy content to one kg of petrol, LPG, kerosene or diesel.” “LPG is generally used for cooking in urban areas while kerosene is the preferred fuel in rural India. A 15 kg LPG cylinder lasts about two months for a family of six. This works out to 15 kg of LPG per capita per year. The same holds true for kerosene. The entire LPG and kerosene requirements of our 100 crore population can be met by methane gas cylinders, produced from the cowdung of 75 million cows.” “Just like CNG, methane gas can be used to run automobile engines in place of petrol. Our petrol consumption last year (2003-04) was eight million tonnes. On the assumption that one cow produces methane gas equivalent to 225 litres of petrol, we will need about 40 million cows to produce an energy equivalent to eight million tonnes of petrol. A generator needs 200 gm of petrol to produce one kilowatt/hour (kwH) of electrical energy. The per capita electrical energy consumption in rural area is 112 kwH per annum. Our rural population being 74 crore, we will need another 85 million cows to meet the electrical energy needs of rural areas. This comes to a total of 200 million livestock to satisfy our energy requirements.”
